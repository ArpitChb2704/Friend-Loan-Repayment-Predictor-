# Friend Loan Repayment Predictor

Link : https://friend-loan-repayment-predictor.streamlit.app

This project predicts the likelihood of a friend's loan repayment using a Neural Network model. The app provides a prediction on whether a friend is likely to repay a loan based on several input features. This is purely a simulated model and does not reflect real-world intentions.

## Features

Neural Network Model: A deep learning model built using a neural network architecture to predict loan repayment likelihood.
Data Preprocessing: Uses preprocessed data for making predictions.
Streamlit Interface: A simple, interactive web app where users can input data and get the prediction.

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a friend will repay a loan using machine learning techniques. The model is based on a Neural Network and is trained on synthetic data to simulate the loan repayment prediction process. It is important to note that this model is not intended to reflect real-world data or actual intentions of friends.

## Requirements

streamlit

numpy

joblib

tensorflow

pandas

scikit-learn

## Files

lending_project.py: Main Streamlit app file for the user interface and model prediction.
lending_prediction_dataset.csv: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
file_gen.py: Script to generate the synthetic dataset for training the model.
friend_lending_model.h5: Pre-trained Neural Network model for loan repayment prediction.
preprocessor.pkl: Preprocessor used to clean and process input data for prediction.

## Important Note

This model and dataset are purely for demonstration purposes. The predictions are based on simulated data and should not be taken as real-world advice or reflective of any actual friendâ€™s intentions.
This app does not suggest any real-world data, nor should you take its predictions personally. It is important to consider other factors and context when dealing with real-life financial situations.
